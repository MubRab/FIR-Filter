# FIR-Filter
An implementation of a FIR Filter on an STM32F4 microcontroller

The STM32F429 microcontroller was used.
The signal was generated using the C in-built *sin* function.

## Filter Characteristics:

- Low Pass filter
- Hamming Window Method
- Cut-off frequency (fc) = 1.5 kHz
- Stopband edge frequency (fs) = 3 kHz
